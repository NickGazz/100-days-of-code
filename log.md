# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 11-13, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Started designing and building a to-do list app with html, css, and javascript on the 11th. Just beginning this challenge on the 14th.

**Thoughts:** So far on this project I have worked with event listeners and animation through jQuery. I've also learned more about objects and their methods and properties, as well as some of the differences between jQuery objecs and dom/html objects. Started on discovering how to store the objects or an array containing them in local storage with the assistance of JSON. Still need to explore css preprocessors more (sylus?) and jQuery might be too bulky and unnecessary for this projects, so considering rebuilding only the core functionality I need. Objects and arrays are also starting to duplicate information, so might need to restructure to simplify.

### Day 1: August 14, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Git installed on computer. Began restructuring javascript

**Thoughts:** Got git installed and pushed the ToDo list to my website hosted through gitHub, but Atom is unable to push to site, so I need to run that in the command line. Resturctured javascript to simplify code by removing all list ids and task ids in html and task and card objects. Reduced script file size by ~10% and got rid of several lines of code. Broke some functionallity in the process, so I still need to go back in and finish fixing references in functions.

### Day 2: August 15, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Finished restructuring js

**Thoughts:** Javascript is now reads much cleaners and uses less event listeners and functions to accomplish the same thing. It should be easier to expand on features and begin fixing up the styles.
